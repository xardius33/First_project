In this pinball game, you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce the ball and prevent it from falling off. The ball bounces off the walls and the paddle, and if it falls off the screen, you lose a life. The game keeps track of your score and remaining lives. The game loop continuously updates the ball's position, checks for collisions, and redraws the screen.
